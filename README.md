## **Overview**

This dataset is RGB elevation tiles of the world converted from open data namely NASADEM (zoom level: 6-12) and Global Map data (zoom level: 2-5). Although we can find RGB elevation tiles dataset easily, sometimes it is difficult to use it because of the copyright. We made these RGB elevation tiles as open data to reduce constraints in the importation of geographical data and make the imported data flexible and effectively usable anywhere. This work is done under the UN Smart Maps Group of UN Open GIS Initiative.

## **Original datasets**

- NASADEM

NASADEM is based on SRTM and complemented by ASTER G-DEM and ALOS 30 meter DEM. It has 1 arc second spatial resolutions (about 30 meters).

- Global Map (ISCGM)

Global Map is fundamental digital geospatial information covering the whole land of the globe. Global Map data were developed under the cooperation of National Geospatial Information Authorities (NGIAs) of respective countries and regions. ISCGM served as the secretariat until the project concluded in 2017.
